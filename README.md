# Scandiweb Junior Developer test

This is a test task for the position of a junior react developer. 
During the development process, I used:
 - React+Typescript
 - Redux-Toolkit
 - GraphQL (@tilework/opus)
 
 The project was completed in accordance with the requirements:
 
 ## Required:

- React. Anything not written in React will be rejected automatically. This is a React position, we expect a React solution.
- Class components. Due to our [work specifics]([https://docs.scandipwa.com/stack/override-mechanism/extending-javascript](https://docs.scandipwa.com/developing-with-scandi/override-mechanism/extending-javascript)) we utilize them heavily.
- Create-react-app to scaffold the application.

## Allowed:

- State management libraries (e.g. Redux, Recoil)
- CSS-in-JS approach allowers (e.g. styled-components)

## Prohibited:

- UI libraries (e.g. Tailwind, Material UI, Ant Design)
- Functional components, due to the reasons described above.
